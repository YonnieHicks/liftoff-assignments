Introducing "Discover Mo Trails", the ultimate hiking app designed to help outdoor enthusiasts discover and navigate the perfect trails for their next adventure. TrailFinder offers an extensive database of hiking trails, complete with detailed information such as trail descriptions, difficulty levels, distances, elevation profiles, and user-contributed photos and reviews. Our app aims to provide a seamless and user-friendly experience, making it easy for hikers of all skill levels to find trails that match their preferences and abilities.

But TrailFinder doesn't stop there. We know that getting to the trail is just as important as the hike itself, so we've integrated real-time traffic information to help users plan their trips efficiently. Users can see current traffic conditions, estimated travel times, and receive alternative route suggestions to avoid congestion, all within the app. With Discover Mo Trails, not only will hikers find their perfect trail, but they'll also enjoy a stress-free journey, making their outdoor experience even more enjoyable.

I will have to learn how to call 3rd party APIs for this project. In addition to that, I believe I will be using Java, MySQL, Thymeleaf templates, Hibernate, and Spring Boot to make the magic of this awesome app happen.
